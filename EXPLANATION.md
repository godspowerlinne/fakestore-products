# Explanation of the Code

## Overview
This project is a simple web application that displays products from a fake store API. It allows users to search, filter, and sort products based on various criteria.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the HTML elements.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the functionality and interactions.

## index.html
- **DOCTYPE and HTML Structure**: Defines the document type and sets up the HTML structure.
- **Head Section**:
  - Sets the character encoding and viewport settings.
  - Links to the CSS file for styling.
  - Includes a title for the web page.
- **Body Section**:
  - Contains a header with a title, search bar, sorting options, and category filter.
  - Displays error messages and loading indicators.
  - Contains a container for displaying product cards.
  - Links to the JavaScript file for functionality.

## style.css
- **Global Styles**: Resets margin and padding, sets box-sizing, and applies a default font.
- **Body Styles**: Sets background color, text color, and line height.
- **Section Styles**: Styles for the main section, including padding and box shadow.
- **Header Styles**: Styles for the header, including margins and text alignment.
- **Search Bar and Button Styles**: Styles for the search bar, buttons, and dropdowns, including hover effects.
- **Product Card Styles**: Styles for product cards, including layout, hover effects, and animations.
- **Error and Loading Styles**: Styles for error messages and loading spinners.
- **Responsive Styles**: Adjustments for smaller screens.

## script.js
### Global Variables
- `let allProducts = [];`: An array to store all products fetched from the API.
- `let filteredProducts = [];`: An array to store products that match the user's search/filter criteria.
- `const API_URL = "https://fakestoreapi.com/products";`: The URL of the API from which products are fetched.

### DOM Elements
- `const container = document.getElementById("container");`: The main container where product cards will be displayed.
- `const searchBar = document.getElementById("searchBar");`: The input field for searching products.
- `const categoryFilter = document.getElementById("category");`: The dropdown for filtering products by category.
- `const errorMessage = document.getElementById("errorMessage");`: The element for displaying error messages.
- `const loadingSpinner = document.getElementById("loading");`: The element for showing a loading spinner.
- `const sortButtons = document.querySelectorAll("button[value]");`: All sorting buttons for sorting products.

### Event Listener for Page Load
- `document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {...});`: This event listener waits for the entire page to load before executing the code inside it. It ensures that all DOM elements are available for manipulation.

### Fetch Products Function
- `const fetchProducts = async () => {...};`: An asynchronous function that fetches product data from the API.
  - **Error Handling**: If the response is not okay, it throws an error and displays an error message.
  - **Display Products**: Calls `displayProducts(allProducts);` to show the fetched products.

### Display Products Function
- `const displayProducts = (products) => {...};`: This function takes an array of products and displays them in the container.
  - **Error Handling**: If no products are found, it displays an appropriate error message.
  - **Creating Product Cards**: Calls `createProductCards(products, container);` to create and append product cards to the container.

### Create Product Cards Function
- `const createProductCards = (products, container) => {...};`: This function creates individual product cards for each product.
  - **Card Structure**: Each card includes an image, title, description, and buttons for liking, disliking, adding to cart, and downloading.
  - **Event Listeners for Buttons**: Each button has an event listener that triggers an alert with the corresponding action when clicked.

### Setup Event Listeners Function
- `const setupEventListeners = () => {...};`: This function sets up event listeners for user interactions.
  - **Search Functionality**: Listens for input in the search bar and filters products accordingly.
  - **Category Filter**: Listens for changes in the category dropdown and filters products.
  - **Sorting Buttons**: Listens for clicks on sorting buttons and sorts products based on the selected criteria.

### Filter Products Function
- `const filterProducts = () => {...};`: This function filters products based on the search text and selected category.
  - **Filtering Logic**: It checks if the product title or description contains the search text and if it matches the selected category.

### Sort Products Function
- `const sortProducts = (sortValue) => {...};`: This function sorts the filtered products based on the selected sorting option (price or name).
  - **Sorting Logic**: It uses the `sort()` method to sort products and then calls `displayProducts(sortedProducts);` to update the displayed products.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to create a simple product display application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases the use of APIs, DOM manipulation, and event handling to create an interactive user experience.
